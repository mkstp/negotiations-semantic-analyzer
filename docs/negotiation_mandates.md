# Background

Traditional position-based bargaining often leads to limited, unsatisfactory outcomes because it focuses on fixed demands rather than collaboration. This adversarial approach, treating negotiations as a zero-sum game, undermines communication and trust—key ingredients for successful resolutions. It centers on taking from the negotiation rather than creating value, often damaging relationships and leaving parties dissatisfied.

In contrast, interest-based bargaining (IBB) shifts the focus from rigid positions to the underlying needs and motivations of the parties. By prioritizing interests, negotiators foster a cooperative and collaborative problem-solving environment. This approach increases the likelihood of mutually beneficial outcomes, leaving both parties more satisfied and preserving long-term relationships.

The Parable of the Orange illustrates the stark difference between the two methods. In position-based bargaining, two parties arguing over an orange each receive half, satisfying neither. However, in interest-based bargaining, their underlying interests—using the orange for zest versus juice—are explored. This results in one party receiving the orange skin and the other the pulp, achieving an optimal outcome for both.

IBB encourages creativity, collaboration, and trust, leading to solutions that address the needs of all parties while maintaining harmony and fostering sustainable relationships. It demonstrates the advantages of focusing on shared interests over adversarial positions.
Description
The following activity is a form of ‘orange problem’, where both sides have mandates that are seemingly incompatible. But through interest based negotiation, both sides can achieve 100% of their mandates provided they establish trust and share all relevant information. 

# Party 1 - Negotiation Brief

Core Mandate Objective: You must secure access from a local fishing village to harvest a rare algae for your research to cure Alzheimer's 

In a quiet coastal research lab, your team of scientists stand on the brink of a historic breakthrough: a cure for Alzheimer’s disease. At the heart of research lies a critical ingredient: a rare algae found in the depths of a delicate marine ecosystem. 

It is true that harvesting the algae may damage the delicate balance of the ecosystem. But with funding running out, you need to harvest what’s left. Out of a sense of responsibility, your lab has voluntarily invested a portion of its funding on an impact analysis and concluded that the ecosystem will likely return to its original state after 10 years, and by then a synthetic drug will be developed and no more algae will need to be harvested. 

Faizer: a multinational for-profit pharmaceutical company, is also in the process of developing a drug using the same algae. They plan to patent the use of the algae, then sell the manufactured drug for a high profit. This lab has a reputation of non-compliance with the environmental protections act, and you know that if they gain the upper hand, they will damage the sensitive ecosystem much more than your team will. Luckily, the local fishing village has offered you priority in their discussion. Not only will you handle the extraction of the algae with the utmost care compared to your competition,  as a non-profit research organization, the drug your team creates will be accessible to all.

This algae, found only in these pristine waters, stimulates neural pathways and repairs memory loss when consumed. You need large quantities of this algae in order to complete the final stages of their research and gain federal approval to start manufacturing a drug. To manufacture this drug, the algae is processed in a bioreactor where its enzymes are extracted, then the effluent is discarded. And although the team has tried for years, you have been unable to grow or synthesize this algae in the lab. 

Your mother has Alzheimer’s, and you know the drug will help to bring her symptoms into remission, but the clock is ticking. Within a few years, her symptoms will become incurable and the drug will no longer be effective. 

# Party 2 - Negotiation Brief

Core Mandate Objective: You must prevent the imminent collapse of your village’s fishing economy, where any depletion of fundamental food sources will cost the livelihoods and health of your village's population.

On a quiet, wind-swept shore of a remote island, your village watches as a team of scientists arrives, their equipment heavy, their expressions determined. For generations, your people have lived harmoniously with these waters, treating every fish, every plant, every grain of sand with the utmost respect. The algae that grows in your protected bay is more than a resource; it’s part of your story, woven into the island’s identity. Now, for the first time, outsiders have come, drawn by the algae’s healing potential. As the village chief, you are the guardian of your people. And now, with the algae’s secrets revealed, you must consider things not only for the present, but for a future yet unseen.

The algae is the sole food source of a certain species of snail, which are in turn a critical food source for the local sea life ecosystem. The snails eat the algae twice, only absorbing its nutrients once they rid it of indigestible enzymes. But removing the algae will make their population virtually extinct. The fish and birds who rely on the snails as their main food source will also die out or leave. And the already struggling economy of the local population will collapse as a result, many people will lose their livelihoods and your population will likely starve in as little as 5 years without the help of costly international aid. 

Faizer: a multinational for-profit pharmaceutical company, has approached you with an offer to offset the economic impacts of harvesting the algae in return for granting them exclusive access. However, the competing lab has a well known reputation of shirking their environmental responsibilities and charging high fees for the drugs they produce, and you worry that the reimbursement will not cover the true costs of the impending environmental damage. You fear your people, in particular the younger generations, will suffer more in the long run. 

Their offer of financial reimbursement would help pay for much needed healthcare services for your village's aging population. Several of the village elders have begun to lose their memories, and you fear that they won’t be able to pass their knowledge on to the next generation.
